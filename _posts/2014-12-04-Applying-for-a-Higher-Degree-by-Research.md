title: Applying for a Higher Degree by Research 
---

It has been some months since I started my new job, but I still haven't submitted my "Application for Admission to a Higher Degree by Research". To be honest I was hoping that I'd be enrolled and cracking on with my research by now but I *do* have a full-time job and things seem to take a lot longer than expected. The daily grind of the job seems to take precedence and before long you realise that another week just passed you by.

The exact list of requirements for applying probably differs slightly for each University but for mine you need the following:

* Curriculum Vitae
* Research Proposal
* Supervisor (recommended *before* you apply) 

The CV is easy, already done. I actually started my research proposal in July! It has been *mostly* done for a little while now but, four months on, it is the administrative side of things that is dragging on. Specifically:

* Finding a supervisor(s)
* Finding a school/faculty!

> I have a Computer Science background and am working in Health Sciences. My field of research covers both disciplines. Where do I enroll? 
 
Initially I wanted to enroll with the School of Computing but for various reasons I really don't want to get into here it all became too hard. What I will say is when you are choosing supervisors:

* Be confident that they are going to **do the right thing by you**
* Make sure **they are interested** in the research topic
* Don't pick someone who does not have time for you
* Don't have too many supervisors
 
Now it looks like I will be enrolling with the School of Public Health. This aligns more closely with the research unit I work in and may actually be a better idea. I still intend to find a supervisor from Computer Science, but that is easier said than done.
