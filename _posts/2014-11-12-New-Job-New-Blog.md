title: New job. New blog.
---

I've been working as a software developer for the best part of 20 years now and I've always had commercial realities impacting the work that I really want to - research! Well, by research I mean being able to experiment more with various alternate solutions to find the best way to do something. Time and money constraints generally keep this kind of thing confined.

Now I have been given a great opportunity to work with a group within a University that will allow me to do more of what I want to do. My job is part-time development and part-time research. I'll be enrolling as a student and my job will contribute towards a PhD. I might not be affected by commercial constraints, but I'll be doing a lot more writing, presenting and writing. Did I say writing?

I quit a job of 14 years to risk a contract job offer **for less money** to do this. I have no regrets.

I did have a blog once, long ago, but to be honest it was a bit rubbish, so I won't be migrating it here. I want to write about my experience as an old (nay, experienced!) developer moving into research and the PhD candidature process. I also want to share the work I am doing. This is a good thing, right? If nothing else, it might help me with my writing.
