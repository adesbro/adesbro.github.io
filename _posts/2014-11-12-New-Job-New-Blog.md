title: New job. New blog.
---

I've been working as a software developer for the best part of 20 years now and I've always had commercial realities impacting my work and the work that I really want to do - research! Well, by research I mean being able to experiment with various tools and frameworks to find a better way to do something. Time and money constraints generally keep this kind of thing confined to work at home.

Now I have been given a great opportunity to work with a group at a University that will allow me to do more of what I want to do. My job is part-time development and part-time research. I'll be enrolling as a student and my job will contribute towards a PhD. I might not be affected by the same commercial constraints, but I'll be doing a lot more writing and presenting. That's right, if I want to go to a conference I'll need to participate!

I quit a job of 14 years to risk a contract job offer **for less money** to do this. But I have no regrets.

I had another blog once, a long time ago, but to be honest it was a bit rubbish, so I won't be migrating it here. I want to write about my experience as an old (nay, experienced!) developer moving into research and the PhD candidature process. I also want to share the work I am doing as much as I can. This is a good thing, right? If nothing else, these posts might help me with my writing.
