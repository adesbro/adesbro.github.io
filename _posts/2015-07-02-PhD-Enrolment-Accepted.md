title: PhD Enrolment Accepted!
---

Wow. It finally happened. I have been offered a place into a Doctor of Philosophy course. It's only taken five months but the offer finally came through. Is that normal? 

I wrote about the [enrolment process](http://www.adrianbrown.id.au/Applying-for-a-Higher-Degree-by-Research/) before but that seems so long ago. As I have neither Honours nor a Masters degree I had to prove demonstrated experience in *some* areas. As I have been working in a research group for the last four years and I have 20 years of experience in software development I must have made a decent case. But for the process to take five months is a bit much.

The letter of offer arrived by email one week after my daughter was born, eight weeks ago. While I was somewhat relieved that it finally came through I had other more important things on my mind, and not just the changing of nappies! I'm afraid she already has me wrapped around her little finger.

After coming back to work after six weeks leave (which is never enough, btw) I also got the news that my conference abstract for later this year was rejected. Oh well, it happens. All my flights and accommodation have been booked and paid for though (by my research group), so I feel somewhat guilty, but I promised to write a paper on the flight over. Eek. ;)

So, six months to candidacy. Yep, full-time PhD and full-time job. I better get crackin'.
